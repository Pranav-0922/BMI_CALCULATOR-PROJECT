# BMI_CALCULATOR-PROJECT
BMI Calculator (Advanced) is a Python application built using Tkinter for the graphical user interface and Matplotlib for visualizing BMI ranges. It calculates Body Mass Index based on height and weight, determines the health category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese), and visually displays the result on a bar chart for better understanding.
